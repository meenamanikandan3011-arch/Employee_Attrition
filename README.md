🧠 Employee Attrition Analysis & Prediction – Machine Learning + Streamlit Dashboard

This project analyzes employee-related data to identify factors influencing attrition and uses machine learning to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the organization.
An interactive Streamlit dashboard is deployed to help HR managers explore insights and make data-driven decisions.
